features:
  - Add ability to set the port used by the Ceph rados Gateway
    service.
    Use the ``radosgw_civetweb_port`` variable to set the port.
    This defaults to ``8080`` to match the ``ceph-ansible``
    default, but the ``radosgw_civetweb_port`` variable must
    be set to the same value in your Ceph and MaaS configurations.
