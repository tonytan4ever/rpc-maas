features:
  - Detailed logging was added to the maas_rally performance monitoring plugin.
  - Automatic stale lock and resource cleanup was added to maas_rally.  This
    makes the plugin more robust and resiliant to transitory environmental
    problems.
  - A configurable quota factor was added to the maas_rally plugin.  This
    allows resource cleanup and performance polling to run asynchronously.
  - The maas_rally plugin will now generate an alarm event when too many
    consecutive intervals (default=3) required cleanup of stale resources.
  - The maas_rally plugin will now generate an alarm event when too many
    consecutive intervals (default=3) were aborted waiting for immature
    locks.
